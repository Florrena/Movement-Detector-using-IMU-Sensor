# Movement-Detector-using-IMU-Sensor
Predicts movement based on IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope)

## 1. Collect & Prepare Data
I collected the data from free android/IOS app called "Sensor Logger" that tracks your activity. With this app i recorded 4 different movements in outdoor environment, each for 30 seconds - standing, walking, jogging and running. I recorded the data from accelerometer and gyroscope.
I retried it couple of times but in the end i chose the ones that were collected during a more natural sessions, making it more representative of real-world conditions.
